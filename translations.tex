		Amid the forces of the Universe,\\
		Among nebulae, stars, and planets,\\
		There lies a mighty force concealed\\
		Its secret I shall now reveal.
	\end{verse}
	
	\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
		It is the power of your will!\\
		Subjected just to your command,\\
		No one can take it away from you,\\
		It acts always and everywhere.
	\end{verse}
	
	\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
		Just think of it, just wish for it,\\
		Then add an effort to your thought,\\
		And every door will open wide,\\
		For you to achieve what you sought!

\PoemTitle*{Mitsumoto from Kyoto}
\vspace{-5mm}
\begin{center}
	(the one with the cat, \textipa{m\textbari \texttoptiebar{ts}u'moto})
\end{center}

\begin{multicols}{2}
	\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
		Once upon a time in Kyoto,\\
		lived a ginger cat --- Mitsumoto.\\
		Jumping through a window high\\
		he brushed a kimono as he flew by.
	\end{verse}
	
	\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
		The silk flew gently, blown by the winds\\
		like a butterly flapping its wings.\\
		It touched a vase --- the vase fell down\\
		tipping a cup on its way to the ground.
	\end{verse}
	
	\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
		The liquid spilled slowly, a drop at a time;\\
		there were sparks, the lamp flickered,\\
		then it got quiet\ldots\\
		Bits of ceramic scattered over the floor,\\
		flowers and petals together no more\ldots
	\end{verse}
	
	
	\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
		Meanwhile, Mitsumoto was resting outside\\
		%observing the clouds as they zipped by,\\
		%gazing at blurs left by clouds in the sky,\\
		gazing at fiery clouds in the sky,\\
		%gazing at gradient clouds in the sky
		watching the mountains far\ldots far away,\\
		``What a wonderful way to start a new day!''\\
		Unburdened, so he soaked in\\
		the rays of the sun, birdsong, and bloom\ldots\\
		The night was gone\ldots
	\end{verse}
	

	\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
		Closing his eyes, in silence he sat\\
		forgetting the world turning under his mat.\\
		He blended with nature, let go of concerns,\\
		%Stundenkontierung and everything else\ldots
		worries, to-do lists and everything else\ldots
	\end{verse}
	
	\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
		Upon his return -- something was odd.\\
		He quietly folded the kimono along.\\
		He wiped the lamp and fixed the switch,\\
		flipped it to test if there's any glitch.\\
		The cup was raised; flowers went to a jar\\
		filling the room with their lively attar\ldots
	\end{verse}
	
	
	\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
		He picked up the fragments, one by one,\\
		arranging them 'til the puzzle was done.\\
		With patience, care and without any rush\\
		he glued them together with the stroke of a brush.\\
		
		Caressing the cracks with lacquer and paint,\\
		%reviving the vase 
		%restoring the vase to its beautiful state
		tracing the vase's tumultuous fate.

	\end{verse}
	
	
	\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
		The vase got stronger than it had been,\\
		and Mitsumoto got wiser, having seen\\
		that broken things can be fixed, made anew,\\
		that beauty can be found in flaws too\ldots
		
		What we can learn from this tale ---\\
		a challenge can help us prevail;\\
		while repairing we mend our own soul\footnote{Here we mean it in the sense of ``a person's total self'', without spiritual connotations.}\\
		finding purpose in making things whole\ldots
	\end{verse}
