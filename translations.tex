\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
	In all the vast and endless space, \\
	among planets, stars and haze, \\
	a mighty power is concealed --- \\
	its secret I will now reveal.
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
	It's yours to use and to control, \\
	a force unique, your very own, \\
	a gift no one can ever steal --- \\
	the \emph{boundless power of your will!}
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
	Just think of something, that's the start. \\
	Then wish for it with all your heart\ldots\\
	And when you go ahead and try, \\
	then many doors can open wide.
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
	Though some won't budge, some will be jammed, \\
	some might open, though not as planned\ldots \\
	Find the zeal to push a bit more, \\
	you might discover a much better door!
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
	A problem's solved -- though it was hard, \\
	your doubts retreat and fall apart, \\
	the tangled mess is now undone, \\
	all barriers, you have outrun!
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
	No wall too high for you climb, \\
	no trick too tricky for your mind. \\
	You feel the strength you have inside, \\
	and let it be your trusted guide!
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
	You simply never, ever quit, \\
	Just go ahead, and start with it! \\
	\textbf{If you ignite the spark within, \\
	all obstacles will soon give in}!

\begin{multicols}{2}
	\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
		Once upon a time in Kyoto,\\
		lived a ginger cat --- Mitsumoto.\\
		Jumping through a window high\\
		he brushed a kimono as he flew by.
	\end{verse}
	
	\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
		The silk flew gently, blown by the winds\\
		like a butterly flapping its wings.\\
		It touched a vase --- the vase fell down\\
		tipping a cup on its way to the ground.
	\end{verse}
	
	\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
		The liquid spilled slowly, a drop at a time;\\
		there were sparks, the lamp flickered,\\
		then it got quiet\ldots\\
		Bits of ceramic scattered over the floor,\\
		flowers and petals together no more\ldots
	\end{verse}
	
	
	\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
		Meanwhile, Mitsumoto was resting outside\\
		%observing the clouds as they zipped by,\\
		%gazing at blurs left by clouds in the sky,\\
		gazing at fiery clouds in the sky,\\
		%gazing at gradient clouds in the sky
		watching the mountains far\ldots far away,\\
		``What a wonderful way to start a new day!''\\
		Unburdened, he soaked in\\
		the rays of the sun, birdsong, and bloom\ldots\\
		The night was gone\ldots
	\end{verse}
	

	\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
		Closing his eyes, in silence he sat\\
		forgetting the world turning under his mat.\\
		He blended with nature, let go of concerns,\\
		%Stundenkontierung and everything else\ldots
		worries, to-do lists and everything else\ldots
	\end{verse}
	
	\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
		Upon his return -- something was odd.\\
		He quietly folded the kimono along.\\
		He wiped the lamp and fixed the switch,\\
		flipped it to test if there's any glitch.\\
		The cup was raised; flowers went to a jar\\
		filling the room with their lively attar\ldots
	\end{verse}
	
	
	\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
		He picked up the fragments, one by one,\\
		arranging them 'til the puzzle was done.\\
		With patience, care and without any rush\\
		he glued them together with the stroke of a brush.\\
		
		Caressing the cracks with lacquer and paint,\\
		%reviving the vase 
		%restoring the vase to its beautiful state
		tracing the vase's tumultuous fate.

	\end{verse}
	
	
	\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
		The vase got stronger than it had been,\\
		and Mitsumoto got wiser, having seen\\
		that broken things can be fixed, made anew,\\
		that beauty can be found in flaws too\ldots
		
		What we can learn from this tale ---\\
		a challenge can help us prevail;\\
		while repairing we mend our own soul\footnote{Here we mean it in the sense of ``a person's total self'', without spiritual connotations.}\\
		finding purpose in making things whole\ldots
	\end{verse}

\vspace{-4mm}
\settowidth{\versewidth}{Despite life's maze they stand and want to share â€“}
\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
	Deep in the woods, where cities are unseen,\\
	where no roads go, and few have ever been,\\
	where human steps so rarely leave a trace\ldots\\
	There live red giants, in that hidden place.
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
	Their trunks, like towers, rise into the blue --\\
	too vast to hug, too grand for our view;\\
	and leafy crowns, majestic in their might --\\
	they make the woods a safe and peaceful sight.
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
	For centuries they stretched towards the sky,\\
	through winters cold, they grew so very high.\\
	The elements would make them bend and sway,\\
	but they held on, and never lost their way.
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
	The summer sun did bake them, hot and bright,\\
	the autumn rains did flood them, day and night,\\
	no lightning's blow could make them crack or skew,\\
%	and forest \textbf{fi}~`res they punched right through!\\
%	\tiny{Through savage forest fires they just grew! }
	 and savage forest fires they punched through!
	
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
	Despite life's maze they stand and want to share ---\\
	how starry nights encourage them to dare\ldots\\
	how songs of birds inspire them to dream,\\
	connect their roots and thrive as one big team;\\
	%help friends through roots, work as a team;\\
	and shelter creatures when the winds hit fast;\\
	and watch the sun and moon as they fly past\ldots
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
	Like ocean tides, the ages come and go,\\
	tree-rings record Earth's stories, as they flow.\\
	The giants know all life before our day,\\
	and they will stand when we all fade away.
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
	Do you suppose they've stood forever strong?\\
	It seems like so, but trust me -- that is wrong!\\
	In every race, in every path of life,\\
	there was a time when first steps came to strife.\\
	So small and shaky, wobbly at their best,\\
	with lots of slips and barely time to rest!\\
	And even these tall, giant, mighty trees,\\
%	begun their lives, as just the smallest seeds\ldots
%   begun their journey as the smallest seeds\ldots
	begun their quest as just the smallest seeds\ldots
\end{verse}
